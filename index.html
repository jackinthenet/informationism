personal statement:
I went through what was by far the strangest time in my life and it has left me changed.
Many threads of things I'd worked on and interests I'd had up until then started suddenly colliding together in a chain-reaction.
Many unexpected implications of things I'd thought about for years started to reveal themselves and nearly left me broken. For a time I was.
I'm still learning how to navigate what feels like a new reality now that I've seen both old and new pieces of the logic behind it that I was barely prepared for.
I find diverse forms of inspiration come easily to me now whenever I think to look for them and sometimes even when I don't.
I also find myself attracting or almost effortlessly bumping into a variety of other fairly unique characters.
The cost was gambling my own sanity for the knowledge I hadn't realized I was so desperately seeking until I realized more of why, and how I wasn't so alone.
So I find myself here writing this at the behest of more than one person I've spoken with lately, and I hope to explain it all much better given time.
I'm still doing what I can to keep my life balanced and maintain my former committments, but I also see this and them as an integrated whole that gradually unfolds.
This is an attempt to start explaining the different parts of my personal philosophy.
I realize better now that this isn't something I can entirely put off until I have more appropriate tools.
To the degree I'm right about things, I hope it doesn't come as too much of a shock, and that I'm able to do my part to help others navigate our world together.
