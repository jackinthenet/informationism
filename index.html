personal statement:
I went through what was by far the strangest time in my life and it has left me changed.
Many threads of things I'd worked on and interests I'd had up until then started suddenly colliding together in a chain-reaction.
Many unexpected implications of things I'd thought about for years started to reveal themselves and nearly left me broken. For a time I was.
I'm still learning how to navigate what feels like a new reality now that I've seen both old and new pieces of the logic behind it that I was barely prepared for.
I find diverse forms of inspiration come easily to me now whenever I think to look for them and sometimes even when I don't.
I also find myself attracting or almost effortlessly bumping into a variety of other fairly unique characters.
The cost was gambling my own sanity for the knowledge I hadn't realized I was so desperately seeking until I realized more of why, and how I wasn't so alone.
So I find myself here writing this at the behest of more than one person I've spoken with lately, and I hope to explain it all much better given time.
I'm still doing what I can to keep my life balanced and maintain my former committments, but I also see this and them as an integrated whole that gradually unfolds.
This is an attempt to start explaining the different parts of my personal philosophy.
I realize better now that this isn't something I can entirely put off until I have more appropriate tools.
To the degree I'm right about things, I hope it doesn't come as too much of a shock, and that I'm able to do my part to help others navigate our world together.

personal history:
I experienced creative mania for the first time in my life, and I'm now doing what I can to prevent it from happening again in such a completely uncontrolled way.
There were many different aspects of my life each contributing to what became a perfect storm for pushing me over the edge into a lot of behavior and beliefs
 that I would not have expected as possibilities for myself.
I used what remained of my rational mind at the time to try to keep myself from causing too much trouble,
 and did what I could to go with the flow not knowing what else to do.
I owe apologies to both people I know and people I don't for any shock and/or strife I might've caused them.
I'm doing what I can to pass on my experience to others, both to make it a gentler one if it's repeated, and to share what seem to be some very real benefits to it.
For the moment as I write this, I feel I've reclaimed some sense of peace now that I'm finally starting to find the words instead of fearing them.
