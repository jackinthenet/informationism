    A war for/against eschatology.
    An unfortunate consequence of the combination of aesthetic coherentism and Schelling points, as well as an ongoing metaphysical debate.
    The core question: Does the world eventually return to nothingness or reach a stable cyclic state?
    The answer: No. It is always possible to define more meaningful states that transcend the current one.
    The answer does not however guarantee against *failed* timelines which "exist" only to be subsumed by others.
    Eschatologists if they discover this likely do so to great dismay.
