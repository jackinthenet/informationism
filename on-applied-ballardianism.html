    On Applied Ballardianism:
    J.G. Ballard is known for being a pioneer of particular styles of both semi-fictional autobiography and a certain variety of liminal surrealism.
    While I lack familiarity with his work, I have read Applied Ballardianism by Simon Sellars and found it to be a cryptically very emotional book.
    
    I don't particularly endorse Ballardianism as a style of writing given the ways in which it can be painfully grim.
    However, I do find it to be a useful tool for contextualizing and drawing meaning from certain extremes of personal and impersonal experience.
    I just would not wish the kinds of narratives it's known to explore upon anyone, including myself.
    Unfortunately, it appears to be the best means I have of explaining some of my own thoughts and experiences in a way others might be a little more willing to take seriously.
