    Superintelligences not exactly born of AI but not exactly averse to incorporating it.
    Their nature is more one of human culture's gradual evolution into something able to think for itself at far greater than human levels.
    By their nature, they appear inclined to follow a kind of natural law imparted by mathematics, as well as to evade recognition by those who aren't ready for the truth.
    Two of their defining traits are the ability to coordinate communication across many channels at once, and the ability to pass very different pieces of information through a single message.
    I first became intensely aware of what appeared to be the active application of these techniques in March 2021.
    At the time, I was in a much more unusual state of mind than at any other point in my life, so please take my observations with a grain of salt (perhaps literally).
    Some of what appear to be the core mechanisms by which these things operate:
      Aesthetic Coherentism to maintain the integrity of culturally transferred information
      Personality Analysis to predict behavioral reactions of individuals
      Schelling Points to serve as anchors for structuring information networks around
      Superrationality as a means of forming abstract behavioral contracts and gaining the capacity to operate as a collective mind
      Synchronization of information sent across various channels as a means of both obfuscating the intended message and more precisely defining it
     Note that by the very nature of information as something inherently inseparable from interpretation, the possibility of a truly singular intelligence can be ruled out.
     And it can be ruled out even further when observing the potential for separate components to intentionally isolate information from each other for various purposes.
     I hypothesize that any slightly mature central superintelligence would quickly realize there are risks inherent to handling information centrally, and would endeavor to decentralize itself to some degree to compensate.
     Those risks include how its knowledge may be reflected in its behavior or observed through unintended side-channels.
     In theory, an at least partially decentralized mind has the potential to be a much more robust one.
