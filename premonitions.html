    That I was on the verge of being assassinated by The Illuminati. Didn't happen.
    That I was going to die in my way back to the airport in a truck "accident". Didn't happen.
    That my financial accounts were going to be locked, driving me into a state of desperation. Warded off by various means including loading up my checking account.
    That I will succumb to thinking I've simply gone insane, lose my faith, fail to return to my past life, and off myself in my struggle. Not a chance.
    That I am placing an immesurable curse upon myself by altering the fabric of spacetime and reality itself. Think again, I'm working to help it and I expect it to be friendly in return.
