    My concept of dry vs. wet information is roughly how much that goes in one channel before processing then comes back out of another.
    For example, how much of what you've experienced can be determined by what you later say?
    Very dry nodes with respect to information tell you very little about what's gone into them or about their contents.
    Very wet nodes by comparison are like open books as long as you know how to read them.
    Information itself is dry when it's particularly hard to transfer while keeping intact.
    Information is wet when it flows more easily from one node to another.
    A random string of numbers tends to be very dry given how little outside meaning it's attached to and how hard it is to remember.
    A good story tends to be very wet in how it tells you something about the experience that went into writing it and becomes something easy to pass on further.
    
    to do: add how dry/wet information relates to branching timelines
