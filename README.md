The short version is I somewhat accidentally figured out how to contort my mind in ways that make it much more natural to work with a variety of unusual problems.

I don't believe anything more than superficially resembling typical human psychology is particularly well suited to working on a number of potentially critical issues with near-future technology.

So being the type of person I am, I'm inclined to do some of the work figuring out how to balance keeping regular life intact with the sheer force of change that is the future.

Hopefully I at least succeed at opening up some of my thoughts to others in ways that make engaging with the same realms of thought an overall gentler and especially a more beneficial experience.
