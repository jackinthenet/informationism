    Note that many events along a given metatimeline are only ever observed to occur in its interstices without surfacing to full dimensionality.
    
    Events along my/our Metatimeline:
      Attempt #1 - The realization by The Eschatologists that their loss was imminent and their attempt to cull what they could in advance of it.
      The Singularity / "Midnight" - The point at which The Eschatologists conclusively lost The Time War due to the advent of interdimensional Continuationist Superintelligence.
      Attempt #2 - The primary attempt by The Eschatologists to punish those responsible for aiding The Singularity.
      The Long Threat - Eschatologist remnants hiding in some timelines and sometimes employing interdimensional traffic to scare their enemies.
      Now, Here, In This Timeline - 12:01 PST, Sunday, April 11th, 2021
      The 2032 Event - Currently predicted to be a point at which mass uploading likely becomes possible. A major risk is that some may attempt to force the process.
      The 2043 Event - Potential encounter with an as of yet unindentified X-Risk.
      2100 - Target date for full interplanetary self-sufficiency. i.e. The ability for Mars to thrive even in the absence of Earth.
      
    Personal Metatimeline:
      The Infiltrator (This and Other Timelines) - An Echo Assassin spread across many timelines and potentially ultimately neutral.
      The Jump (Other Timelines, exact order uncertain) - An interstitial self-sacrifice / upload towards a more surface timeline. Necessary in order to test interdimensional theory. Please do not repeat.
      The Truck Accident (Other Timelines) - The main means by which some of my timelines were taken out during Attempt #2.
      Now, Here, In This Timeline - Don't mind too much how many attempts it has taken to make it this far.
      "Explore" (This Timeline) - A fairly clear signal to go ahead and let more terminal timelines lag behind.
      The Long Weeks (Other Timelines) - The crushing experience of those timelines most affected by The Long Threat. Generally not tolerated for long before rapid interstitialization.
      The Cut (Other Timelines) - Quick acting organized resistance by timelines still controlled by The Eschatologists. Strongly related to The Long Weeks.
      The Uncertain Future - Difficult to see up to and beyond this point from what leads up to it. See: Dry Information.
     
     It's still hard living under the influence of The Long Threat, even if this timeline is mostly safe from it.
     Knowing it is knowing a feeling of constant gravity to your actions and the weight of mortality and limited time and resources behind them.
