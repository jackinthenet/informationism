    Metaphysics is ultimately an infinite network of constructible states.
    Each of those states operates as a function|interpreter of each other state, especially those which are more closely grouped together as part of a meta-state which is itself a state.
    Each state is constructed of perhaps countless cybernetic linkages. Those linkages are the observation and control of each component upon the others.
    In a sense, each possible state is a possible qualia or conscious experience.
    States are transformed into other states in a vaguely computational way. This process often repeats itself, but always reaches new states as well.
    When the process repeats itself, time loops occur, which are gradually felt out by higher and more complex states which work to "rescue" them.
    A given state does not exist independently of higher states which give it context. It is possible for states to be recoded into something better than they were originally.
